Therefore, the development of anomalies and attacks detection methods has been the goal of analyses. In the paper the binary classification-based approach to network traffic safety monitoring is presented. The well known methods were applied to artificially modified network traffic data and their detection capabilities were tested. More detailed interpretation of the nature of detected anomalies is carried out with the help of the XAI approach. For the purpose of experiments a new benchmark network traffic data set was prepared, which is now commonly available.}

This paper gives a survey for the research development of network congestion control in the past twenty years. The evaluation index of the ideal congestion control protocol is introduced, such as stability, fairness, efficiency, etc. Several network models and analysis methods are also given for the development of the congestion control, such as the nonlinear model, the control theory, the optimization method. On the basis of massive research of the congestion control issues, there is the generalization of the end-to-end protocol and intermediate nodes. Some open problems have been discussed for the further research of network congestion control.}

abstract = {In this paper we evaluate the effectiveness of Random Early Detection (RED) over traffic types categorized as non-adaptive, fragile and robust, according to their responses to congestion. We point out that RED allows unfair bandwidth sharing when a mixture of the three traffic types shares a link. This unfairness is caused by the fact that at any given time RED imposes the same loss rate on all flows, regardless of their bandwidths.We propose Fair Random Early Drop (FRED), a modified version of RED. FRED uses per-active-flow accounting to impose on each flow a loss rate that depends on the flow's buffer use.We show that FRED provides better protection than RED for adaptive (fragile and robust) flows. In addition, FRED is able to isolate non-adaptive greedy traffic more effectively. Finally, we present a "two-packet-buffer" gateway mechanism to support a large number of flows without incurring additional queueing delays inside the network. These improvements are demonstrated by simulations of TCP and UDP traffic.FRED does not make any assumptions about queueing architecture; it will work with a FIFO gateway. FRED's per-active-flow accounting uses memory in proportion to the total number of buffers used: a FRED gateway maintains state only for flows for which it has packets buffered, not for all flows that traverse the gateway.},

abstract = {Today, networking hardware is not fast enough to save energy with rate adaptation. Or is it? While we are not (yet) able to turn on and off line cards in milliseconds, we can do so a couple of times per day. The question is, does it make sense to save energy?It may: We estimate we could potentially save in the order of MWh per year with link sleeping and down-rating in a cloud provider network. Importantly, these are "easy" gains: They would come without modifying the routing state nor impacting the quality of service of the traffic; it only leverages the typically low utilization of the links. This study provides only a rough approximation of the potential savings of rate adaptation and leaves several practical questions open. More than anything else, it motivates further investigation of the approach.},
